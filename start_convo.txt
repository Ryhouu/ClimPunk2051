Hi, Ron! This is from Chrono.
We have decoded a file from 2051, it looks like a manual for dealing with the climate change. 
But we are not that good at this decoding .... some important details seem to be lost. 
You know, it's getting hotter and hotter these days.
We need your help!
    * Yes, of course. I'm ready to be sent to 2051 to figure out what's going on there. (self.parent.resp = True)
